Towers

Implementation of Towers of Hanoi in Java

The objective is to move every marker from the first pole to either of the other poles. Markers can only be placed on
empty poles or on top of other, smaller markers.

Movements are taken as two numbers, 1-3, taken one at a time, FROM tower and TO tower.
