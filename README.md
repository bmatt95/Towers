Towers
======

Implementation of Towers of Hanoi in Java

The objective is to move every marker from the first pole to either of the other poles. Markers can only be placed on
empty poles or on top of other, smaller markers. Game can be started with any number of markers, but numbers less than 3
have no point.

Movements are taken as two numbers, 1-3, taken one at a time, FROM tower followed by TO tower.
